INTRODUCTION
============

These are the instructions for managing JMSG topic plugins for the JMSG_UDP
and JMSG_MQTT apps. The term JMSG generically refers to a Basecamp JSON text
message. The UDP and MQTT JSON message conventions are nearly identical and 
are based on the MQTT standard. Each message has a topic name that uses the
MQTT path standard. Basecamp's UDP topics have a colon appended to the end
of the topic name to serve as a delimeter between the topic name and JSON
payload. The payloads for botH UDP and MQTT are JSON objects.
 
Both apps require JMSG_LIB and JMSG_APP to be installed. Technically,
JMSG_APP is not required but it provides a command and telemetry interface
to JMSG_LIB that is helpful.

The design supports using either JSMG_MQTT or JSMG_UDP seperately or isntalling
both apps. See the JMSG_LIB documentation for different use cases.

These instruction cover the following material:

1. Configuring default plugins provided by JMSG_LIB, JMSG_UDP, and JMSG_MQTT
2. Add new plugins

See the JMSG_LIB documentation for creating a new JMSG network app equivalent
to JMSG_UDP and JMSG_MQTT

==============================
1. Configuring Default Plugins
==============================


=====================
2. Adding New Plugins
=====================


adding an MQTT topic plugin. Topic plugins 
define functions for converting between MQTT messages and cFE SB messages.
- The MQTT_GW app is typically located in cfs-basecamp/usr/apps/
- [app] is your user app name. SC_SIM is commented out in MQTT files to
  serve as an example
- It is recommended to place app MQTT plugin in files in fsw/mqtt and include
  a file named mqtt_install.txt that explains how to install the app's plugin
  from the app's perspective
- In cfs-basecamp/cfe-eds-framework/basecamp_defs/cpu1_mqtt_gw_ini.json make
  sure the "MQTT_BROKER" configurations match your situation

App plugin creation steps. See MQTT_GW app docs
for a more detailed explanation. SC_SIM provides
a working example that can serve as a reference.
#################################################

1. Create a fsw/mqtt subdirectory in your app's repo
2. For each topic create a header file that
   - Includes "mqtt_gw_topic_plugins.h"
   - Defines event IDs based on MQTT_GW_TOPIC_#_BASE_EID
   - Defines an object class type [APP]_MQTT_TOPIC_CMD_Class_t 
   - Defines a global constructor function
3. For each topic create a source file that defines
   - A cFE SB message to JSON message converter
   - A JSON message to cFE SB message converter
   - A test function

App plugin creation steps. See MQTT_GW app docs
for a more detailed explanation
#################################################

1. Add the following lines to mqtt_gw/CMakeLists.txt.

   include_directories(${[app]_MISSION_DIR}/fsw/mqtt)
   aux_source_directory(${[app]_MISSION_DIR}/fsw/mqtt APP_SRC_FILES)


2. Update the following sections in mqtt_gw/fsw/topic_plugins/mqtt_gw_topic_plugins.c.
   Each constructor is added to an MQTT_GW_PluginTopic_# where # is the
   plugin identifier. 

   - In the "Include files" section add
   
     #include "[app_name]_mqtt_topic_[topic_name].h"

   - In "Global File Data" declare topic plugin data
     
     static [APP_NAME]_MQTT_TOPIC_[TOPIC_NAME]_Class_t  [AppName]Topic[TopicName];

   - In MQTT_GW_TOPIC_PLUGIN_Constructor() add a call to your app's plugin
     constructor in the plugin topic switch statement.
     
     [APP_NAME]_MQTT_TOPIC_[TOPIC_NAME]_Constructor(&[AppName]Topic[TopicName], &PluginFuncTbl[i],
                                                    CFE_SB_ValueToMsgId(TopicTbl->Topic[i].Cfe));

3. In your app's plugin header file [app_name]_mqtt_topic_[topic_name].h, ensure your
   MQTT_GW_TOPIC_PLUGIN_#_BASE_EID identfier # matches the ID used in step 1
   
4. Add your plugin to cfs-basecamp/cfe-eds-framework/basecamp_defs/cpu1_mqtt_gw_topics.json. This 
   file contains detailed instructions

    {
       "mqtt":  "basecamp/[app_name]/[topic_name]",
       "cfe-#": 0,
       "cfe": 0,
       "sb-role": "pub",
       "enabled": "false"
    }

Creating an app that uses JMSG_LIB versus creating plugins for 
==================================================== 
- App's using JMSG_LIB: Add JMSG_LIB cmd mid to ini file, Subscribe to JMSG_LIB command topic, register command, Update ProcessCommand    
- Configure JSMG_USR
- Add topic table load/dump
- Register JMSG_LIB commands
- Dynamic registration
1. Create plugins following MQTT discrete
2. Configure CPU1 jmsg_topics.json table: map top id, and enabled
3. Create app test that repeatedly calls JMSG_LIB function
